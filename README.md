# formula-1
Package for Formula 1 racing data analysis

## qualifications.py
This is a practice script to quickly generate the qualifications time for each driver in the 2021 season using API from [Ergast](https://ergast.com)

## time_record.py
This script is used to take a timestamp every time a driver code is entered. The timestamp then will be processed further in Tableau to calculate the on-screen duration of each driver to analyze how broadcasting is conducted in the sport.
